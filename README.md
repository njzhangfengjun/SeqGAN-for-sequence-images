# SeqGAN-PyTorch
A implementation of SeqGAN in PyTorch, following the implementation in tensorflow.


## Tested with:
* **PyTorch v1 Stable**
* Python 3.6
* CUDA at least 8.0 (For GPU)

## Origin
The code is rewritten in PyTorch, utilizing the inter layer similarity of sequence images to generate high-resolution images

## Runing
```
$ python main.py
```
After runing this file, the results will be printed on terminal. You can change the parameters in the ```main.py```.
